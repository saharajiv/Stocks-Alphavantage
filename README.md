Progress DataDirect OpenAccess REST IP code for Alpha Vantage API for accessing the data using ODBC and JDBC drivers

Do you have a custom API that you use in your company internally and would like to connect to your favorite analytics tool, or integrate with any other tool using standards based connectivity like ODBC/JDBC?
 
Do you have a data source which has a REST API and doesnâ€™t have a ODBC/JDBC driver, but you would like to have one for your analytics or integration purposes?

If so, you're at the right place. This tutorial will get you started in building your own ODBC/JDBC driver using Progress DataDirect OpenAccess SDK. In this tutorial, I will build a ODBC driver for a free financial REST API provided by Alpha Vantage, which offers real time and historical stock market data.
